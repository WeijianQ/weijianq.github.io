I have found some project ideas during my PhD study that I think are interesting and can be done in a short time. I am happy to mentor you if you are interested in any of them.

Here is a [writing sample (UIUC netid required)](https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kunwu2_illinois_edu/EfCwsEFeXLtLjRKzOWMlzFUByvszAt58zMOMZWDJx8S2aA?e=qLhGD8) to take a look at what to expect from a mentorship program and the nature of study in our domain. 

Here is [another project proposal (UIUC netid required)](https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kunwu2_illinois_edu/Eea3Ku01fLBKqjJOAnJVWzIBhTk9ERtjhQmdKF7-is-zOw?e=NBD3Jc) I wrote for the ECE 508 course I TAed this semester.
