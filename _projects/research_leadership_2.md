description: |
 · Proposed IR-based code generator to systematically bridge the gap between programming interface and kernel APIs, and decouples models, data layout, kernel-specific optimization from each other.
 · Achieves up to 9.9× speed-up in inference and 43.7× speed-up in training compared with public state-of-the-art system in RGCN, RGAT, HGT.
 · Proposed one inter-operator optimization and two intermediate data layout options to further accelerate the system to deliver up to 3.8× speed up.
